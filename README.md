### What I learned

1. HTML Structure:

Start by creating the HTML structure for your product review card. You can use a combination of HTML elements like div, img, h3, p, and others to structure your card.

2. CSS Styling:

Next, you'll use CSS to style your product review card. You can add styles to format the card's layout, typography, and overall appearance.
